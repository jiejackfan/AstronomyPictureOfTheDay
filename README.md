State the problem you are trying to solve.
- If you are someone who is interested in astronomy, there isn’t a dedicated place to find and share astronomy-related pictures with friends. Also, it’s hard to manually browse old Astronomy Pictures of the Day on the NASA website. 

Include a description of at least two types of users that would use your Web application

-Astronomy enthusiasts

-Researchers 

For each of the types of users, provide two goals the user would like to achieve with your Web application:

1. Access pictures based on the date and share it with others by posting it on their “homepage”
2. Learn more about what happened on a certain day based on the given description which can be used as an educational tool or simply used by astronomy enthusiasts. 

State the overall strategy of how you intend to solve the problem
- Our application will allow users to easily find/search for/share astronomical pictures. Shared pictures will go on a gallery page of the site, where people can just browse through shared images if they don’t want to find their own via the search feature. For researchers, each image will have a description with information about the picture. 

One of the main requirements is to work with data available from some public, free, Web API. Provide a brief description of the Web API you intend to use:

NASA’s APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) API allows developers to find interesting astronomical pictures by searching criteria like date, keyword, picture quality. The API will return JSON data where each image contains information such as copyright, date released, explanation, picture URL, and version.
